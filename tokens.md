It's interesting to hear your perspective on the release of ChatGPT and Google's chatbot. While external perceptions can certainly shape the actions of companies in the competitive field of AI, it's essential to note that the development of AI models like GPT-3 and chatbots involves complex research, engineering, and innovation processes.

Different AI models and chatbots can have varying strengths and weaknesses, and user experiences can vary as well. Factors like the `size of the model, training data, and fine-tuning techniques` can influence the quality of responses and user interactions.

Competition among companies often leads to advancements in technology, and user preferences can play a significant role in shaping the market. It's possible that Google is actively working to improve its chatbot offerings in response to the success of ChatGPT and similar models.

Ultimately, the field of AI continues to evolve, and users benefit from the ongoing development and competition among companies, as it leads to the creation of more capable and engaging AI-driven applications. Your feedback and experiences as a user are valuable inputs that contribute to the refinement of these technologies.
